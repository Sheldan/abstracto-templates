Adds an assignable role to the given assignable role place.
The display text is used as text for the button and the optional emote is used in front (Only emotes from a server the bot is in can be used)
The mentioned role will be assigned once a member clicks on the button and will be added at the _end_ of the assignable role place (if the post exists already).
