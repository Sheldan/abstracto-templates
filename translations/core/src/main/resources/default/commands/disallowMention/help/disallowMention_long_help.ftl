This command can be used to disallow the bot to use certain mentions. These mentions can be everyone, here, role or user mentions.
The everyone and here mention are controlled via one combined mention type. This change is immediate and only affects the current server.
The mentions will still be displayed as mentions, but will not actually notify users.
