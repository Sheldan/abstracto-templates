This command can be used to create a profanity regex which can be used to detect and replace profanities (or any text).
A profanity regex consists of a profanity name (to identify it), a [regex](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/) and an optional replacement.
The name of a regex is unique within its profanity group.
