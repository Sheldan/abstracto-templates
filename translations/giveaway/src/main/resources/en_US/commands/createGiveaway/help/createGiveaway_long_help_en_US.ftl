This command can be used to create a giveaway.
A giveaway needs a title and a duration.
Additional optional parameters are: description, benefactor (the user who sponsored the giveaway), a channel different to the post target and an amount of winners.
Per default there is 1 winner and the post target 'giveaways' is used.
A giveaway will then automatically evaluate the winners, but it can be cancelled.
The giveaway can then also be rerolled.
