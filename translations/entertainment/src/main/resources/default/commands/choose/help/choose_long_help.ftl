This command can be used to select a choice from a provided list of choices.
The choices need to be space separated and there can be an arbitrary amount of them.
If a choice needs to have spaces in it, the complete choice needs to be wrapped in ". For example "this choice" is considered one object to be chosen.
The wrapping " will not be part of the final output. Only one choice will be chosen, and a sole choice as input is also possible.
