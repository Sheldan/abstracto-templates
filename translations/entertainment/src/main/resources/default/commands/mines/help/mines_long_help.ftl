You can create a minefield with at most 5x5 dimensions and a custom amount of mines.
If you reveal a field which is not a mine, you will either uncover all adjacent free fields or show a number how many files are adjacent.
If you reveal all fields (by clicking) which are no mines, you win!
If economy is enabled, you have the ability to put some credits on the line, and potentially win a multiple of it.
The result of the winnings depend on how many fields you managed to uncover, how many fields and mines there were in total (the more of both, the more credits) and if you completely uncovered the field.
