This command can be used to change the configuration of currently existing streamers. In particular:
If the streamer has an associated member in this server. Do this by mentioning a member in the command.
The target channel of the streamer. Do this by mentioning the channel in the command.

If you provide something that does not fit the format, the property will be removed.
For example pass "no member" as the target member, and the member will be removed.
