Create a server wide poll with possible arguments.
You can select to allow additional options, show the decisions within the poll message and whether multiple options are allowed to be selected.
You can enter at most 15 options and define a duration to show when the poll should end.
If the duration ends and the appropriate feature modes are enabled, the poll will be evaluated and a reminder will be send and the poll will be closed.
