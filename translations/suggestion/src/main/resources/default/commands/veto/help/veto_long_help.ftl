Vetos a given suggestion. The difference to the `reject` command is that the text and the state is a different one.
This command is not final. A suggestion can be rejected/accepted/vetoed multiple times. Once it reaches any of the final states, it will be deleted from the database after a few days.
After that no actions are possible.
